========================

(without the accompanying talk it won't make much sense though)

###Acknowledgements
* Cory Doctorow - Geek, author of Little Brother and Homeland, philosopher [@doctorow] (https://twitter.com/doctorow) who I once saw talking about open source on Vimeo and who talked about it in terms of the "age of enightmenment", the Renaissance, comparing it to historical development of the scientific method. This blew me away so I wrapped it into my presentation on Open Source.
* Carl Reynolds [@drcjar] (https://twitter.com/drcjar) through whom I saw the Vimeo video
